Goblin-Mage-Knight Game

This is my sample github repo for demo purposes to show students that github can be a platform to display your portfolio.

Player and computer chooses either goblin, knight, or mage. The winner is determined by the following logic:

goblin beats mage
knight beats goblin
mage beats knight
